"""Confirm the vendored third-party files still match what was vendored.

Vendored code is a copy, so it drifts in two directions and both are silent. A
local edit looks like a fix until the next re-vendor reverts it, and an upstream
release leaves this copy quietly old. Neither shows up in a diff of this repo.

The record lives in vendored.json, written when the file was vendored. This
compares the file on disk against that record, and can additionally diff against
a checkout of the upstream repository.

    python3 tools/check_vendored.py                      # has the copy changed?
    python3 tools/check_vendored.py --upstream ../ewfprobe
    python3 tools/check_vendored.py --update             # after a deliberate re-vendor

Drift and "could not check" are reported separately and exit differently. They
are different results: one says the copy is wrong, the other says nothing was
compared, and folding the second into the first turns an unreachable upstream
into a finding that reads as a defect.
